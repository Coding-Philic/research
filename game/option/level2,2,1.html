      <p><strong>Question:</strong> What is the term for a share in the ownership of a company?</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Bond</li>
        <li>Stock</li>
        <li>Loan</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="answer-box">
      <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> 2. Stock</p>
      <p><strong>Reason:</strong> A stock represents a share in the ownership of a company, and it constitutes a claim on part of the companyâ€™s assets and earnings. Bonds and loans are forms of debt, not ownership, so they are not the correct answer in this context.</p>
