      <p><strong>Question:</strong> What does a budget help you do?</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Spend more money</li>
        <li>Plan your income and expenses</li>
        <li>Increase your credit score automatically</li>
      </ol>

    <div class="answer-box">
      <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> 2. Plan your income and expenses</p>
      <p><strong>Reason:</strong> A budget is a financial plan that helps you manage and track your income and expenses. It allows you to allocate money for specific needs, save for future goals, and avoid overspending. While budgeting may indirectly impact your credit score over time, it does not automatically increase it, nor does it encourage spending more money.</p>
