      <p><strong>Question:</strong> Which of the following is an example of a liability?</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Money in a savings account</li>
        <li>A loan taken from a bank</li>
        <li>A car owned outright</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="answer-box">
      <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> 2. A loan taken from a bank</p>
      <p><strong>Reason:</strong> A liability is a financial obligation, such as a loan, that you are required to repay. In contrast, money in a savings account and a car owned outright are assets, as they represent items of value you own.</p>
