      <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> 1. To store money and earn interest</p>
      <p><strong>Reason:</strong> The primary purpose of a savings account is to store money safely and earn interest over time. It is a low-risk option for individuals to keep their money while earning a small return. Taking loans or buying stocks is not the primary function of a savings account.</p>
